        In 2020 Rini and Pieter bought Manezinho, a restaurant on a very beautiful spot at the coast of Urzelina. It used to be famous on the islands at the beginning of the century but had been closed for a couple of years. After almost a year of renovation the place opened its doors again as Grand Café Manezinho in October 2021. The name was kept but the formula is different: a place where people can relax, see art and listen to live music. In Manezinho there is a permanent exposition of works by Pieter.
