    <h2>About Pieter Adriaans</h2>
    <article class="rj-about-article">
      <p>
        Upon arriving in the Azores, Pieter Adriaans was enchanted by Azorean popular music.
        As a musician and artist, he was curious to learn to play the viola da terra – for the instrument and for its social and cultural importance.
        This is how he arrives at festivals and pilgrimages and finds his performers, the players – individuals of relevance in the community they inhabit and in the perpetuation of the history of this instrument.

        In addition to playing, he uses his artist's hand to create a series of paintings of these players and moments where Azorean popular music is experienced.

        The exposition will be open till the end of May 2022.
